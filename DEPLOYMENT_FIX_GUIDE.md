# 🚀 Deployment Fix Guide - Build Errors Resolution

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**

The build is failing because your deployment environment is using a branch that has:
1. **Missing UI Components**: `dialog.tsx` and `select.tsx`
2. **Deprecated Supabase Import**: `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`
3. **Missing Components**: `DemoFileManager.tsx` and other dashboard components

## ✅ **Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Update Deployment Branch (Recommended)**

**Your deployment is currently using a branch that has the problematic files. You need to update it to use the working branch.**

#### **For Render Deployment:**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your YukiFiles service
3. Go to **Settings → Build & Deploy**
4. Change the **Branch** from current to:
   ```
   cursor/ki-m-tra-l-i-build-v-giao-di-n-mobile-fced
   ```
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Click **"Manual Deploy"** to trigger a new deployment

#### **For Vercel Deployment:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your YukiFiles project
3. Go to **Settings → Git**
4. Change the **Production Branch** to:
   ```
   cursor/ki-m-tra-l-i-build-v-giao-di-n-mobile-fced
   ```
5. Go to **Deployments** and click **"Redeploy"**

### **Option 2: Use Main Branch (Simpler)**

**The main branch is already working and doesn't have the problematic files.**

#### **For Render Deployment:**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your YukiFiles service
3. Go to **Settings → Build & Deploy**
4. Change the **Branch** to:
   ```
   main
   ```
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Click **"Manual Deploy"**

#### **For Vercel Deployment:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your YukiFiles project
3. Go to **Settings → Git**
4. Change the **Production Branch** to:
   ```
   main
   ```
5. Go to **Deployments** and click **"Redeploy"**

## 🚨 **If You Still Get Errors**

If you continue to get build errors after changing the branch:

1. **Clear Deployment Cache:**

   - In Vercel: Go to Settings → Git → Clear Cache

2. **Force Redeploy:**
   - Trigger a fresh deployment without cache

3. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set
   - Supabase URL and keys are configured

## 📞 **Support**

If you need help:
1. Check the deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify the branch is correctly set
3. Ensure all environment variables are configured
4. Contact support with the specific error messages

## 🎉 **Expected Result**
